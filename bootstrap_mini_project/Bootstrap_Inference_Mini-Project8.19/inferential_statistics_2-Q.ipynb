    "In the previous frequentist mini-projects, you did frequentist calculations to perform inference from a sample of data. Such inference relies on theory largely developed from the 19th-Century onwards that is subject to certain assumptions or theoretical limits. These are fine if those assumptions hold for the particular case you're working on, and what you want to do has a known theoretical distribution (for example the mean of a sampling distribution that we looked at in the previous mini-project.)"

If frequentism is about using assumptions and theoretical results to calculate what we expect to happen were an experiment to be run again and again and again, then bootstrapping is about using computing power to essentially re-run the sample draw again and again and again to see what actually happens."

    "The confidence interval above is often a useful quantity to estimate. If we wish to limit our expected probability of making a Type I error (where we wrongly reject the null hypothesis, and it is, instead, true) to $\\alpha$, the associated confidence interval is our estimate of the interval within which we expect the true population value to be found $100\\times(1 - \\alpha)$% of the time we do this test. In the above we performed bootstrap replicates to estimate the interval and reject the null hypothesis if this interval did not contain zero. You will sometimes see such an interval reported in the output of statistical functions.\n",

    "The partner of the confidence interval is the p-value. The p-value and the confidence interval are linked through our choice of $\\alpha$. The p-value tells us how likely it is, under the null hypothesis, to get an outcome at least as extreme as what was observed. If this fails to reach the level of our _pre-specified_ $\\alpha$, we decide the null hypothesis is sufficiently unlikely to be true and thus reject it. To calculate this p-value via the bootstrap, we have to put ourselves in a position where we are simulating the null hypothesis being true and then calculate the fraction of times we observe a result at least as extreme as that actually observed.\n",
