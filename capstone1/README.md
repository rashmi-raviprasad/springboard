# Capstone 1: Predicting a Galaxy's Rotation

This project is the first capstone for the Springboard Data Science course. The goal of this project was to see if one could predict whether a spiral galaxy rotates clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) relative to us based on features such as position in the sky, brightness, and tilt angle. I was able to reach an accuracy of 66%, which is 2% higher than the literature on this topic<sup name="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>.

## Steps

This analysis was conducted in four stages.

1. [Data wrangling](https://github.com/rashmi-raviprasad/springboard/blob/master/capstone1/data_wrangling.ipynb) - wrangling and cleaning the raw data 
2. [Statistical Analysis](https://github.com/rashmi-raviprasad/springboard/blob/master/capstone1/inferential_statistics.ipynb) - performing statistical inference on the data
3. [Machine Learning](https://github.com/rashmi-raviprasad/springboard/blob/master/capstone1/machine_learning.ipynb) - creating and testing out models for prediction
4. [Final Report](https://github.com/rashmi-raviprasad/springboard/blob/master/capstone1/Capstone%201%20Final%20Report.pdf) - write-up of project
